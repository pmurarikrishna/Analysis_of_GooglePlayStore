# The Android App Market on Google Play
## Project Description
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of over ten thousand Android apps in Google Play, aiming to uncover insights for driving growth and retention strategies. The analysis includes app categorization, user ratings, downloads, pricing models, and user retention.


Applying pandas data manipulation skills, I analyze a dataset of over ten thousand Android apps in Google Play to extract insights for growth and retention strategies.

The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. The data files are as follows:

apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.
